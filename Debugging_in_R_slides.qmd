1.  Identify the bug

4.  Reproduce the bug

5.  Fix the bug

6.  Prevent prevent bug

## 1. Identify the bug

First, create expectations:

-   in your mind

-   with unit tests ([testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/))

Then, check those expectations (frequently)

-   With investigative functions like `print()`, `head()`, `str()`, `View()`, 
`range()`, `table()`, `class()`

-   with unit tests ([testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/))

## Common Problems
-   Typos/syntax errors
-   **Object is not the class that you think it is**
-   Variable is not the type that you think it is
-   Variables missing from data
-   Missing values (NAs) in the data
